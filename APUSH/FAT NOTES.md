## Time Period 1 & 2 (1491-1607, 1607-1754):

Important Concepts from Early Contact period:



* Native populations in North America were not monolithic; they were diverse. Tribal groups varied widely in their economies, level of civilization, and interaction with each other and Europeans
* The Columbian exchange revolutionised both European and NAtive cultures by expanding trade and technology and creating a racially mixed New World, stratified by wealth and status.
* African slavery started in this period, gradually replacing Native slavery and European indentured servitude

Important Concepts from colonization of North America:



* Europeans and Native Americans vied for control of land, fur, and fishing rights
* The Spanish, French, Dutch, and British had different styles of interacting with Native populations

 


## Pre-Columbian North America & Native Americans:



* **Bering Strait** - Theory of a land bridge for how natives got to the Americas.

**Religions:**



* Vibrant spiritual world with ceremonies

### Causes for European Exploration:



* Crusades increased European’s want for Asia’s Luxuries (spices, silk, drugs)
* Renaissance gave Europeans an ambitious spirit.
* Marco Polo’s diaries and the printing press spread curiosity and ideas.


## Imperialism:


### The Spanish:

Summary:


> Tended to conquer and enslave the native inhabitants of the regions it colonized. The Spanish also made great efforts to convert Native Americans to Catholicism. Spanish colonists were overwhelmingly male and many had children with native woman, leading to settlements populated largely by mestizos, people of mixed Spanish and Native American ancestry
> 
> **Main Goals:** 	Spread their Roman Catholic faith and extend the king’s wealth and power, also MONEY.


#### Conquistadors - Spanish conquerors in the new world 



* mainly with the help of disease, horses, ruthless tactics, and metal weapons like guns
* Hernan Cortez - Conquered the Aztecs
* Fransisco Pizzaro - Conquered the Incas


#### Spanish Explorers:



* Juan Ponce de Leon - traveled to Florida in 1516 looking for the fountain of youth.
* Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca - looked for gold in the American South.


#### Encomienda System - The crown granted colonists authority over a specified number of natives; the colonists were obliged to protect those natives and convert them to Catholicism, and in exchange, the colonists were entitled to those natives’ labor for sugar harvesting or silver mining.



* Were not legally slaves but created a brutal system of forced labor that led to many abuses
* Native population couldn’t meet demands of labor and slavery began to increase
* **Bartolome de las Casas** - disagreed with the system and become an eloquent critic of mistreatment towards Native Americans


#### Treaty of Tordesillas (1494):



* Split the New world land between Spain and Portugal along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa.


#### Pope's Rebellion / Pueblo Revolt (1680):



* Spanish gained control of Pueblo people and disrupted the Pueblos’ traditional culture by forcing them to labor on encomiendas and worship in Catholic missions
* The Pope led the revolt, killing hundreds of Spaniards and destroying their buildings and burning fields.
* When Pope died, the Spanish successfully conquered the Pueblos, but became more acceptable to cultural accommodations and became a mix of Spanish and Pueblo cultures


#### The Black Legend:



* An excuse for English settlers to expand west because they needed to “provide safety” for Natives from the cruel Spanish.
* While the Spanish were “cruel” to natives, some Spanairds married Natives, which is reflected in South American culture today.
* The English were also very cruel to the natives.


### The French:

Summary:


> France had significantly friendly relations with indigenous tribes, tending to ally with them, adopt native practices, and marrying them. The French had little choice in this: French settlements were so sparsely populated that taking on the natives head-on would have been very risky.
> 
> **Main Goals:** Fur Trapping



* Arrived in hopes of finding natural resources (gold) and shortcut to Asia
* Mainly fur trappers (coureus de bois) and traders, developing a lucrative fur trade with Indian tribes.
* Primarily single men who sometimes intermarried with women
* Friendly to Natives
* Land was primarily owned by the King, but any land ownership with by Catholics only 
* **Huguenots** - French protestants


### The Netherlands: 

Summary: 


> The Netherlands attempted to build a great trading empire, and while it achieved great success elsewhere in the world, its settlements on the North American continent, which were essentially glorified trading Post, soon fell to the English. This doesn't mean they were unimportant. One of the Dutch settlements was New Amsterdam later renamed New York City.



* The Dutch Republic became a leading colonial power after a rebellion against Catholic Spain and The Three Great Anglo-Dutch Wars.
* 1623 - New Netherland was established near the Hudson R.


### The English:

Summary: 


> England differed significantly from the three other powers in that the other three all depended on Native Americans in different ways: as slave labor, as allies, or as trading partners. English colonies by contrast attempted to exclude Native Americans as much as possible. The English flooded to the new world in great numbers with entire families arriving in many of the colonies rather than just young men, intermixing was rare. Instead when English colonies grew to the point that conflict with nearby tribes became inevitable, and the English launched wars of extermination. For instance the Powhatan Confederacy was destroyed by English “Indian fighters” in the 1640s

## 
     \
Time Period 3 (1754-1800):


Summary:



* Britain's increase attempts to control the colonies and impose burdensome taxation led to the colonists desire for revolution 
* France, Britain, Spain, and the United States viewed for control of land; the borders of the new United States were constantly expanding
*  the common people had changed their view of government. The belief in egalitarianism  and democracy replaced trust in monarchy and aristocracy.

**French and Indian War / 7 Years War (1754-1763)** - A conflict between the British and France who allied with Natives caused by a dispute in territory of the Ohio River Valley.



* Britain won, signing the Peace of Paris (1763).
* Louisiana territory, once France's, was given to Spain. British doubled land territory in North America, gaining the Ohio River Valley.
* British westward expansion led to increased tensions between Natives and the Colonists. (Proclamation of 1763)
    * Ex: Ottawa leader Pontiac led a raid against the colonists.

**The Treaty of Paris of 1763:**



* Great Britain won because the 1.2 million people in its 13 colonies outnumber the 75,000 inhabitants in New France
* The Treaty of Paris of 1763 ended French power in North America as Britain took title to Canada, Spanish Florida, and all the French islands east of the Mississippi River 

**French And Indian War Significance:**



* The victorious end of the war sparked strong feelings of colonial pride. Having supplied 20,000 soldiers and spent over two million pounds. The colonists view themselves as important and loyal partners of the British Empire 
* While the British leaders also celebrated their glorious victory, the long war left Britain with a great empire and an enormous national debt that had double to 130 million pounds
* The looming financial crisis forced Britain's young and untested King George III and his first minister George Grenville to reassess their colonial policies. Greenville reached a fatal decision when he insisted that the colonies had to begin paying a fair share of the "cost of the Empire." 

**Proclamation of (1763)** - To keep Native and colonial tensions under control for trade and protect colonists, the British passed the proclamation which forbade colonists from settling in the Ohio River Valley.



* Marks the end of salutary neglect 
* Land-hungry settlers ignored the Proclamation line and soon poured into Kentucky

Context:



* The French defeat left Native Americans in a vulnerable position by ending long-standing trade and military alliances. Native Americans could no longer negotiate favorable agreements by playing the French and English against each other 
* Confident in their Superior military positions, the British was held traditional gifts of guns, powder, and lead. Unwilling to submit to the British, Chief Pontiac turned anti-british animosity into an uprising designed to expel the unwanted Redcoats from Indian lands.(pontiac’s Rebellion)  The British finally suppressed Pontiac’s warriors at a cost of over 2,000 lives 
* Deeply frustrated the colonists who felt they were entitled to the land after winning the French and Indian War.

**The Albany Congress (1754)** - Meeting of colonial representatives that called for a more centralized government in defence of the colonies.



* After many British losses in the French and Indian War, the British government called for a congress of colonial representatives to assemble a more organized response to frontier defense and trade and westward expansion.
* **Albany Plan of Union** - Benjamin Franklin proposed and called for a more centralized government for the colonies. Plan was rejected because taxes would’ve been too high.
    * Laid plans for future revolutionary congress.


## Taxation Without Representation:

In order to pay for the French and Indian War (which doubled the British debt) the British imposed a series of taxes on the colonies. The era of Salutary Neglect was over. Colonists were frustrated with taxes because they did not feel like they had representation in Parliament.

**Navigation Acts (1763)** - Stricter enforcement of existing navigation laws, which angered colonists because they often smuggled goods to avoid such laws.



* Until 1763, navigation laws were loosely enforced (salutary neglect).

**Sugar Act (1764)** - Taxes on coffee, wine, and other luxury items. Also stricter enforcement of the existing Molasses Act (1733).

**Quartering Act (1765) **- Imperial troops can remain in a colonist's homes even after the war ended.



* Colonists were responsible for feeding and housing soldiers.

**Stamp Act (1765)** - Taxes on everything paper (newspapers, playing cards, contracts, etc.). It was the main push for colonists to complain about taxation without representation.



* Especially threatening to the colonists who experienced declining wages and a rise in unemployment.
* Colonists began complaining about taxation without representation, but British leaders said they had virtual representation (representation for classes instead of region).
    * Colonists were not happy as they had grown accustomed to local government.
    * Groups like **Sons & Daughters of Liberty **dedicated themselves to the repeal of the stamp act.
* It did mark the beginning of an increasingly device dispute over the relationship between Parliament and the colonies 

**Stamp Act Congress (1765)** - 27 delegates from nine colonies who assembled in New York to write a petition to the British Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act. 



* Main Reason: Taxation without representation was tyranny.
* At the time, colonists were still loyal to the British Crown. British subjects were trying to obtain the full rights of British citizens.
* Their nonimportation agreements brought the first of America together.
    * Ex: They made home made clothes and garments.
* Parliament repealed the Stamp Act and Sugar Act (1766). This was attributable to protests, lives of tax collectors and destruction of property in the colonies.

**Declaratory Act (1766)** - British Parliament declares they have the right to pass any law on the colonies. Due to Parliament rescinding the Stamp Act reasserting their authority over the colonies.

**Townshend Acts (1767)** - Taxes on glass, white lead, paper, paint, and tea.



* This led to highly organized protests.
* Their protester’s main plan was to boycott many British goods.
    * This was largely influenced by women because they purchased goods for the family.
    * Women began to spin their own cloth, making/brewing herbal tea.

**The Boston Massacre (1770)** - A group of boys threw snow and rocks and harassed the imperial troops stationed in Boston. The tension grew and it led to a massacre. (11colonists wounded, 4 dead)



* Was a sure sign of increasing British tyranny.

**The Boston Tea Party (1773)** - 50 colonists disguised as Indians boarded a merchant ship and dumped about 5 tons of British tea into the harbor.



* It was a response to the Tea Act (1773). It gave the British East India Company exclusive rights to buy and ship tea in the colonies, which angered colonists who like smuggled Dutch tea.

**Coercive Acts (1773)** - In response to the Boston Tea Party, Parliament closed down the Boston harbor until the tea was paid for.



* A new quartering act came along too.

**Quebec Act (1774)** - granted greater liberties to Catholics, whom the Protestant colonial majority distrusted and extended the boundaries of the Quebec Territory further impeding westward expansion

**The Intolerable Acts (1774)** - A term coined by colonists to describe the “intolerable acts” British parliament passed.



* Patriots began to organize themselves to protect themselves from British tyranny

**Committees of Correspondence** - organized by patriot leader Samuel Adams, was a system of communication between patriot leaders in New England and throughout the colonies. They provided the organization necessary to unite the colonies in opposition to Parliament. The committees sent delegates to the First Continental Congress.

**The First Continental Congress (1774)** - Leaders from colonies gathered to resist further violations of their liberties at the hands of parliament. All colonies sent delegates except Georgia. Congress imposed a boycott on British goods.



* **Republic** - where power flowed from the people themselves.
* **Natural Rights** - “All human beings are endowed with certain rights by God, and not a government, and therefore a government can never take them away”
* **Social Contract**- “The power to govern is in the hands of the people and they willingly give over some of that power to create government capable of protecting their natural rights” 
* **Separation of Powers** - “Enables the various branches to check and balance the power of the others.”

## Birth of a New Nation (1781-1800):

**Articles of Confederation (1781)** - Drafted from local governments that put the power in the legislative body. It was the Constitution of the United States.



* All power from the federal government was in the legislative body. There was no executive branch or judicial branch.

* Shays' Rebellion highlighted the Articles of Confederation’s faults.

**Land Ordinance 1785** - US government would sell, at auction, Western lands for a minimum of $1 an acre. Profit used to pay off national debt.

**Northwest Ordinance of 1787 **- Westward migration increased already high tensions between Natives and Americans. The Articles of Confederation established how unformed territories could apply for statehood, and it outlawed slavery in the Northwest territory.

**Shays’ Rebellion (1786) **- A thousand impoverished farmers/veterans, led by Daniel Shays, planned to riot but were quickly stopped.



* It displayed the weakness of the Articles of Confederation. There was no national army or president to resolve such a situation.

**Constitutional Convention (1787)** - Convention held to revise the articles of confederation into a stronger document. This resulted in the beginnings of the new constitution. Two factions began to form, as many delegates disagreed with each other:



* **Federalists** - Urban folks who wanted a strong central government.
* **Anti-Federalists** - Rural folks who enjoyed their state governments, and opposed federal government power.

Delegates from states also had differing ideas about how states should be represented in government:



* **Virginia Plan** - State representation should be based on population. This favored big states.
* **New Jersey Plan** - State representation should be equal regardless of size. This favored smaller states.
* **The Great Compromise / Sherman’s Plan (1787)** - Combining both the Virginia and New Jersey plan, the legislative branch will be split into two houses, or a bicameral congress.
    * **House of Representatives** - States would be represented by population.
    * **Senate** - All states have two votes and are represented equally.
* **⅗ Compromise** - Slaves count for ⅗ a person to represent the population.
* The new constitution would provide a more robust central government with checks in balances in the three branches.

**Federalist Papers** - In an effort to get states to ratify the new Constitution, Alexander Hamilton, John Hay, and James Madison wrote 85 articles and essays to convince the public about the merits of the Constitution.

**Constitution of the United States (1789)** - Constitution goes into effect.

**Election of 1788-1789** - Washington becomes president and John Adams vice president.



* Washington established the departments of treasury and state, and war and justice.
* **Alexander Hamilton** becomes the first Secretary of the Treasury. He would influence a lot of Washington’s policies. (loose constructionists)

    * **Elastic Clause **- Congress has the right to make any law necessary and proper to carry out its responsibilities.
* **Thomas Jefferson** -** **secretary of state (favored weaker federal government)
    * Strict constructionists like James Madison

**After the Revolution:**

There was a desire to define American culture after the American Revolution. State and national leaders proposed ambitious plans for public education. Artists devoted attention to painting historical themes (Charles Wilson Peel, Samuel Jennings).

**Louisiana Purchase** **(1803)** - James Monroe was sent to France to negotiate land rights in the Louisiana Territory. The French had no use for the territory since they'd lost Haiti to the Hatian Revolution. Monroe bought the land for 15 million dollars.



* This contradicted Jefferson’s values of strict construction, because the Constitution does not give president's power to buy land. However, he liked the land because it would allow for his view of an agrarian nation.

**12th Amendment (1804)** - Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates shall be voted for separately. If no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote, then the House of Representatives will choose the President from the highest vote-getters.

* Midnight Judges: Federal justices appointed by John Adams during the lasts days of his presidency
* John Adams appointed Federalist judges, one of whom was William Marbury. Jefferson did not like this Federalist dominance ,so he instructed Secretary of State James Madison to not deliver those appointments. In court, John Marshall decided that under the Judiciary Act, Marbury deserved his commission, but in the end, Marbury did not receive his commission, due to the Judiciary Act being unconstitutional.

**Embargo Act of 1807** - Shut down America’s import and export business, with disastrous economic results

Context:

Tecumseh was killed fighting for the British during the War of 1812 at the Battle of the Thames in 1813.

**War of 1812** - This was a war between the US and Britain. Britain caused by American outrage over the impressment (kidnapping and of American sailors by the British, the British seizure of American ships, and British aid to the Indians attacking the Americans on the western frontier. 



* Also, a war against Britain gave the U.S. an excuse to seize the British northwest posts and to annex Florida from Britain's ally Spain, and possibly even to seize Canada from Britain. **The War Hawks** - (young westerners led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun) argued for war in Congress. The war involved several sea battles and frontier skirmishes. U.S. troops led by Andrew Jackson seized Florida and at one point the British managed to invade and burn Washington, D.C.

* The war strengthened American nationalism and encouraged the growth of industry.
* **Treaty of Ghent (1814)** - Ended the War of 1812 and restored the status quo. For the most part, territory captured in the war was returned to the original owner. It also set up a commission to determine the disputed Canada/U.S. border.

*  it made Andrew Jackson into a celebrity and pave the way to his presidency
*  the victory in New Orleans led to National euphoria
*  the popularity of the war destroyed the Federalists, who had opposed it, and taught American politicians that objecting to going to war could be hazardous to their careers 
* Spurred **American manufacturing** - Cut off from trade with Europe the States became more self-sufficient by necessity
    *  New England became America's manufacturing center during the war and after the war, the US was less dependent on imports than it had previously 

**Hartford Convention (1814)** - Opposition to the War of 1812 from the Federalists prompted them to call a convention. They discussed how to end the war and even said New England should secede from the Union. This marked the end of the Federalist party.

**Bank War (1832-1836)** - Jackson vs. Bank & Biddle; Jackson begins taking out funds and putting them into pet banks, successfully "killing" the bank; leads to fluctuation in economy and eventual panic; Jackson believed the Bank of US had too much power and was too rich. Vetoed the 2nd Bank charter and withdrew gov't money from the US Banks and put it into "pet banks."

**Specie Circular - **Ended the policy of selling government land on credit (buyers had to pay hard cash)



* Jackson preferred hard currency (gold/sliver)
* Caused by the money storage and sharp decrease in treasury
* Triggered** the Panic of 1837**
    * Causes:
        * Speculation by banks （giving people loans who couldn’t pay it back)
        * Jackson’s policies
        * Failure of 2 British Banks (1836) which caused investors to call in foreign loans.
    * Effect:
        * Congress overturned the circular in last days of Jackson’s final term

**Election of 1836** - Martin Van Buren (“The Little Magician”, and Democrat) became 8th President of the US.



* Martin Van Buren was Jackson’s vp. William Henry Harrison (whig) ran against Buren but lost.
* Martin van Buren entered the presidency during the major economic crisis (the panic of 1837) 
    * Buren made the situation worse by continuing Jackson's policy of favoring hard currency ensuring that money would be hard to come by. The economic downturn lasted through Van Buren's term, practically guaranteeing that he would not be re-elected 

**Election of 1840** - William Henry Harrison (1st Whigs President) became the 9th President of the United States, only to catch a cold at his inaugural address and died. John Tyler, who was his vp, became the 10th President of the United States.

**Election of 1844** - James K. Polk becomes 10th President of the United States.

**The Oregon Treaty (1846)** - The treaty brought an end to the Oregon boundary dispute by settling competing American and British claims to the Oregon Country, which had been jointly occupied by both Britain and the U.S. since the Treaty of 1818. It set the U.S. and British North American border at the 49th parallel with the exception of Vancouver Island, which was retained in its entirety by the British.

**The Mexican-American War** **(1846-1848)** - 

Causes: 



* Texas declared independence from Mexico (1836). This caused increased conflict between Mexicans and Texans.
* **Annexation of Texas (1845)** - The Mexican government was okay with Texas being independent, but when Texas wanted to join the Union, it was a reason to fight.
    * Jackson, Van Buren, Harrison and Tyler decided against the annexation.
    * James K. Polk’s campaign promises included the Annexation of Texas. Tyler then annexed Texas right before his presidency ended, for the credit.
* Polk sent diplomat, John Slidell to Mexico city to ask for more land from Mexico (NM & CA), and to settle the location of the Southern border of Mexico
    * Mexico said the border ran along the Neuces R., while America said the border ran along the Rio Grande R.

* 1846 - Congress declares war on Mexico.
* **General Winfield Scott** - Conquered and occupied Mexico City, which forced Mexican negotiations. Ran for president.

Effects:



* **Wilmot Proviso (1846)** -  David Wilmot added a rider (or provision) attached to an appropriations bill during the Mexican War. It stated that slavery would be banned in any territory won from Mexico as a result of the war. It was never passed.
* **Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)** - Ends the Mexican-American War.
    * Establishes the Rio Grande as the Southern Border of Texas.

* **Free Soil Pary** - Was organized by anti-slavery men in the north, democrats who were resentful at Polk's actions, and some conscience Whigs. The Free-Soil Party was against slavery in the new territories. They also advocated federal aid for internal improvements and urged free government homesteads for settlers. This Free-Soil Party foreshadowed the emergence of the Republican party.


## Society:

The War of 1812 brings nationalism and the end of the Federalist Party. The Era of Good feelings gives mass support for the Democratic Republicans. Missouri confronts the issue of slavery.

**Immigrants:**

The Market Revolution caused a rise in population and diversity in Northern industrial cities. Between 1820 and 1840, around 2 million immigrants (mainly German and Irish) came to the US. They mostly settled on the East Coast, fueling Northern industry with cheap labor. These immigrants changed the urban landscape, forming a growing class or laboring poor. They lived in crowded housing called tenements. Sanitation was not well practiced in these areas, and disease spread rapidly. However, in these places, immigrants were able to preserve their cultural background.

**Middle Class:**

The growing middle class emerged from the North and included people like businessmen, shopkeepers, journalists, doctors, and lawyers. They spent the disposable income on leisure activities like plays, sporting events and circuses.

**Women:**



* Women were expected to conform to a developing societal norm:
* **Cult of Domesticity** - A woman's identity and sense of purpose revolved around childenbearing and making her home a haven of rest for her husband. Husbands were expected to work and provide.
* Magazines and newspapers were published to persuade them.
* It was mainly an upper class, and middle class phenomenon. In lower classes, women had to work to survive.

**Expansion of Democracy - **Working men, small farmers,  and frontier settlers began to demand the right to vote, especially after the Panic of 1819. By 1825, many states removed property qualifications for voting.

During the 1830’s, language, philosophy, art, and religion became outlets for American identity. 

Reform movements also started around this time. Temperance, abolition, and women’s suffrage became more popular. 

**_American Dictionary of the English Language_ (1828)** - Published by **Noah Webster**, and was used in schools and academics. It standardized the spelling and pronunciation of American English.

**Transcendentalism** - 



* **Ralph Waldo Emerson** - Believed that moral perfection can be achieved in the US.
* **Henry David Thereau** - Made experiments of human perfection at Walden Pond, and made a book: _Walden._ 

**Hudson River School of Artists** - Painted romanticized landscapes in New York and the Western territories. This reflects the growing popularity of art and expression of American identity.

**Utopian Communities** - Groups that were usually very influenced by Europeanintellectuals and American values of democracy and equality.



* **Oneida Community (1848)** - Group of Christians who became convinced that the second coming of Christ had already occurred and therefore should live communally.  Complex (everyone belonged to everyone) marriage was introduced.
* **Shakers** - 

**Second Great Awakening (1790-1840)** - A series of religious revivals starting in 1801, based on Methodism and Baptism. Stressed a religious philosophy of salvation through good deeds and tolerance for all Protestant sects. The revivals attracted women, Blacks, and Native Americans. It also had an effect on moral movements such as prison reform, the temperance movement, and moral reasoning against slavery. 



* Unlike the 1st Great Awakening, whose preachers focused on personal moral reformation, the 2nd Great Awakening focused on moral reformation of society:
    * **Charles Finney** - A New York preacher who helped the abolitionist cause spread North.
    * **The American Temperance Society (1826)** - Was founded and reflected the increasing reformers advocating for temperance. Mainly targeted working class men who abused alcohol.
    * **Temperance societies** were promoted by Protestant churches and reformers and tied to the rise in Irish and German immigrants who are mostly Catholic, representing the divide between the two branches of Christianity 
* **Mormonism / Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (1840s)** - Founded by Joseph Smith during the Second Great Awakening, members believe that they belong to the restored church created by Jesus Christ. Smith claimed to receive visions from God saying the churches in America had strayed from the true teachings of the church. He found buried golden plates and translated them into the Book of Mormon.
    * Members were often persecuted because they didn't keep slaves, they practiced polygamy, and they were outsiders for their religious beliefs.
    * Brigham Young and the Mormons settled in Utah.
* Penitentiaries, asylums and orphanages began bringing reformed with the notion that Society is responsible for the welfare of its least fortunate 
    * **Dorothea Dix** - penitentiaries sought to rehabilitate criminals rather than isolate them by teaching them morality and a “work ethic” 

**Abolitionist Movement **- It picked up support



* **_The Liberator _(1831) - **Published by **William Lloyd Garrison**, he argued that white folks neede to take a stand against slavery by the means of moral persuasion and voilence.
    * Was an **immediatist** - wanted emancipation 
* **The American Anti-Slavery Society** **(1833)** - Spread rapidly across the Northern States for abolition. Northern merchants and manufacturers feared abolition because of its influence on the cotton and sugar trade, and losing their jobs. 
* **Frederick Douglass **- 1840s began publishing his influential newspaper _the North Star_.
    *  Douglas, an escaped slave, gained fame as a gifted writer and eloquent advocate of freedom and equality 
    * his _Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass _is one of the great American autobiographies 
* **Harriet Tubman - **Escaped slavery and returned South repeatedly to help more than 300 slaves escaped via the Underground Railroad (a network of hiding places and safe Trails); 
* **Sojourner Truth** - a charismatic speaker who champaigned for emancipation and women's rights 

**Women’s Rights / Suffrage Movement** - For women to be more effective in their campaigns for abolition and temperance, they needed the right vote.



* **Seneca Falls Convention (1848)** - Women gathering in New York for the 1st women’s rights conference in America.
    * **The Declaration of Sentiments** **(1848) **- Women drafted and demanded women’s equality, education, legal rights, and voting rights.Taken from the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men **and women** are created equal…”

**The North:**



* Becoming industrialized
    * technological advancement advances in Communications, Transportation, industry, and baking we're helping it become the nation's commercial center. 
* Farming played less of a role in the northeastern economy than it did elsewhere in the country 
* legal slavery became increasingly uncommon in the region's States through the early 1800s

**The South:**



* Westward expansion was coupled with depleted soil. Expansion with slavery gave plantation owners enormous wealth, which created a walthy plantaion aristocracy which sought to protect their profits towards keeping slavery.
* However, African American culture rose through song. It created a rhythm for their work and expressed their collective despair and hopes.
* Nat Turner’s Rebellion (1831) increased the fear amongst white Southerners about a slave rebellion or uprising.
    * The government then imposed harsher laws on slaves.
* **F**White Southerners who were independent land owners, and didn’t own slaves. They belived in slavery because of the racial heirarchy that made the Southern society work.

**The West: **



* Economic interests were varied but we're largely rooted in commercial farming, fur trapping, and real-estate speculation. 
* Westerns generally distrusted the north, which they regarded as the home of powerful banks that could take their land away. 
* They had little more use for the South, whose rigidly hierarchical Society was at odds with the egalitarianism of the West. 
* Most westerns wanted to avoid involvement in the slavery issue, which they regarded as irrelevant to their lives. Ironically western expansion was the core of the most important conflicts leading up to the Civil War 


## Time Period 5 (1848-1877):


## Rising Slavery Sentiment:

**Manifest Density** - The term was coined in the 1840s and espoused a philosophy that the United States had a God-given right to “overspread” the continent. At the heart of the doctrine was the notion that Americans were a superior people with superior governmental institutions, and they had superior moral character.



* **John O. Sullivan** wrote in a newspaper the American phenomenon to expand Westward (1845).
* It articulated American’s feelings and their practical reasons for Westward expansion:
    * More access to minerals and natural resources (Gold).
    * **California Gold Rush** - After gold was discovered in 1848, many Americans moved to the State hoping to strike it rich.
    * Gold discoveries in Colorado, the Dakotas and Nevada also pushed for Westward expansion.
* **Preemption Acts (1830-1840)** - Congress' preemption acts of the 1830s and 1840s gave squatters the right to settle public lands and purchase them for low prices once the government put them up for sale. This pushed westward expansion.
* Mostly the middle class moved West.
* Religious refuge also pushed for westward expansion. Mormons, who were prosecuted for their belief, moved to Utah.

**Compromise of 1850** - Henry Clay proposed Mexican cession divided into Utah and New Mexico territories and would practice popular sovereignty. California would be admitted as a free state, slave trade would be banned in Washington DC, and a stricter Fugitive Slave Law would be enforced.



* It gave Southerner's motivation to call for succession because it disrupted the balance in the Senate.
* Widely opposed in both the North and South, it did little to settle the escalating dispute over slavery.
* **The Fugitive Slave Law (1850)** -The law made it legal to arrest runaway slaves anywhere in the United States. The slaves could be returned to their owners. A person who helped runaway slaves faced fines and jail time. Free men also had the potential of becoming slaves.

**Effects of Compromise of 1850:**



* Clearly stacked in favor of the north with CA now in the union, the balance in the Senate was now tipped against the South and in favor of the North
* Stephen Douglas introduced the **Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854).**

**Election of 1852** - Franklin Pierce (Democrat) becomes the 14th President of the US.



* He ran against Windfeld Sott (Whigs).

**Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) **- Proposed that because the Senate was so off-balance Douglass proposed that the Nebraska territory be split into Nebraska in the North, Kansas in the South. The new states decide the slavery question by **popular soverignty**



* Assumed that Kansas being directly west of Missouri (slave state) would vote for slavery 
* Assumed that Nebraska being west of Iowa (free state) would vote against slavery.

**Consequences of the Kansas-Nebraska Act:**



* The Kansas-Nebraska Act broke the uneasy truce between the North and the South. Indignant Northern Democrats denounced the act as a violation of the Missouri Compromise “sacred pledge" to ban slavery north of the 36-30 line
* This marked the first important test of popular sovereignty. With in a short time, **Bleeding Kansas Bleeding Kansas (1855-1861)** - Voilence in Kansas, sparked by the argument over slavery. The states became a battleground between rival pro-slavery and antislavery settlers 
* Outpouring of popular opposition in the north that led to the formation of the **Republican Party in 1854**. 
    * Within a short time, wigs, anti-slavery Democrats, free soilers, and former know-nothings joined the rapidly-growing Republican Coalition. 
    * The rise of the Republican Party begin a new third party system that dominated American politics until the 1896 presidential election 
* The Kansas-Nebraska Act dealt a severe blow to Douglas presidential aspirations. At the same time, it revitalized Abraham Lincoln's political career becoming a Republican
* The Whig party was split between Cotton Whigs (proslavery) and Conscience Whigs (antislavery)

**Election of 1856** - James Buchanan (Democrat) became the 15th President of the US.



* He ran against John C. Breckenridge (Republican).
* The Whigs mainly collapsed and joined the Republican Party or the No-Nothings.

**Dred Scott Decision of 1857** - Chief Justice Roger Taney (Southern Democrat) ruled against Scott:



1. As a slave, Dred Scott was not a  Citizen and therefore had no right to sue in federal court.
2.  The Constitution clearly states that Congress cannot deprive any citizen of property.
    1. Thus, slave owners could take slaves anywhere they wanted without fear of being deprived of their property.
* Dred Scott was an enslaved man who lived in Missouri. His master took him to live in Illinois and Wisconsin, both free states. Scott sued his master for his freedom.

Impacts:



* The decision would mean that any territory in the union would be opened to slavery.

**Harper’s Ferry (1859)** - A raid, led by John Brown, at the federal arsenal, Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. Their intention was to steal weapons, distribute to enslaved folks, and ignite an armed rebellion. They were able to capture the armory, but were repulsed by the military, led by Robert E. Lee. John Brown was hanged for his plan. 



* Brown was linked to many other abolitionists which Southerners saw as a Northern plot against them.

**Election of 1860** - Abraham Lincoln (Republican who ran on a Free Soil Platform) became the 16th President of the US. He ran against Stephen Douglas (Democrat).



* Lincoln emphasized that he did not want to abolish slavery, but the South saw his canadicy as a threat to their way of living.
* Unable to bridge the division of a slavery, the Democratic party split into two factions
    *  Northern Democrats nominated Steven A Douglas on a platform promising Congressional non-interference with slavery. (Popular sovereignty)
    *  Deep South Democrats nominated John see Breckenridge on a platform calling for a national salve code that would protect slavery in the territories. They wanted a federal slave code.
* Republican sensed they had an excellent opportunity to defeat the divided Democrats. **The Lincoln-Douglas debates** transform Abraham Lincoln into a nationally-known figure the party nominated Lincoln on the 3rd ballot
    * Republican party stated that slavery would continue to be protected in the states where it already existed. however the Republican Party firmly oppose the expansion of slavery into the western territories 
* Lincoln won the election by carrying all 18 free states. He did not win a single state in the south 

**The Crittenden Compromise **- Lincoln's election promoted South Carolina and six other deep south states to secede from the Union. 



* In a final desperate effort to save the union, Senator John Crittenden of Kentucky proposed keep finding constitutional amendment to extend the Missouri Compromise line to the West Coast 
* Lincoln rejected the Crittenden Compromise because it violated the Republican party's steadfast position against the further extension of slavery into the western territories. The nation thus continued on an inexorable path to disunion and a bloody Civil War 
* December 1860 - SC secedes from the Union. Others followed and created the:

**Confederacy of America** - Constitution for the Confederacy, and very similar to the US Constitution. However, it had severely limited federal power, and provisions that made slavery a permanent institution. 



* **Jefferson Davis** became the 1st Confederacy President with vp as Alexander Stephens.


## Society Before the Civil War:


## Massive changes take place due to the industrial revolution.


### Slavery:



* **Southern Position** -  They believed Slavery was a constitutional right and slavery had been decided in the Missouri Compromise.The Missouri Compromise was a garuentee to the South that their way of living would continue.
* **Free Soil Movement** - It was composed of Northern Democrats and Whigs who wanted new territories acquired to be the dominion of free laborers. Many wanted to stop the spread of slavery, not to abolish it.
    * The movement had many opposing ideas.
    * **Aboltionism** - People who wanted to ban slavery everywhere.
        * Many of them founded the Free Soil Party.
* **Popular Sovereignty** - People of their territory determine the status of a free or slave state.


### Regional Differences in Slavery:

**North:**



* **Economy**: stimulated by free wage workers working manufacturing jobs in factories
* Population was growing rapidly. 
* Many Northerners didn’t reject slavery because of economic reasonings.  However, the expansion of slavery could bring an end the free wage workers. This ideology was adopted by **the Free Soil Party**, and was largely in support of the **Wilmot Proviso (1846)**.
* **Abolitionists** - They were the minority, but became highly influential because  of their tactics:
    * Through the Written Word: 
        * **_The Liberator _by** **William Lloyd Garrison.**
        * **_Uncle Tom’s Cabin _(1852)** - **Harriet Becher Stow** wrote a fictional book that publicized the dehumanization and brutality of slavery in graphic detail. Southerners tried to ban the book.
        * **Frederick Douglas** - Escaped Ablolistionist slace, he would often speak out about slavery in public.
    * **UnderGround Railroad** - A series of safehouses which enslaved people could find a safe passage to the North.
    * **John Brown** - Abolitionist who believed the only way for America to be freed of slavery is through the means of a slave uprising in the South (Harper’s Ferry in 1859).

**South:**



* **Economy**: fueled by slave labor working on agricultural plantations


### Immigration:



* Tons of Irish immigrants settled in cultural enclaves (ethnic communities) in NYC. This kept a lot of their cultural customs, languages, and religion. 
    * They lived in slums, where diseases were rampant, unemployment was the growing norm, and infant mortality rates were one of the worst in the country.
* German immigrants settled in urban locations on the coast, and a greater proportion moved West in search of land to farm.
* **Nativist** - This movement sprang up and is a policy of protecting the interests of native-born people against the interests of immigrants. The Irish were Catholic and not Chritians or Protestants, and so they became targets of the Nativist invective.
* **Know-Nothing Party** - Born from Nativist incentive, the Party had a strong opposition against slavery. They were given their name because they literally didn’t know anything.
    * Focused on limiting immigrant’s cultural and political influence.


## The Civil War (1861-1865):


### Advantages and Disadvantages of Both Parties:

**North:**



* **Manufacturing**
* **New York City Draft Riots (1863)** - Drafts could be avoided with $300. Working class men felt it was an injustice, and a protest turned violent. 120 people were killed.

**Border States - **Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri were all slaveholding border states that remained in the Union



* Kentucky provided industrial and agricultural resources that proved vital to the union 

**Battle of Fort Sumter (1861)** - First battle of the Civil War. Lincoln sent supply ships to Fort Sumter, which was a military base in the South. The Confederacy blew up the supply ships.

**First Battle of Bull Run (1861)** - 30,000 Union troops confronted Confederate troops. The Union was winning, but Stonewall Jackson led Confederate reinforcements which destroyed the Union. 



* This reflects the early Confederate wins in the Civil War.

**Northern Economy: **



* Northern economy received a boost from the war as the demand for war related Goods such as uniforms and weapons, spurred manufacturing 
    * The loss of SOuthern markets harmed the economy at first, but soon the war economy brought about a boom period
* Like the South, the North experienced a period of accelerated in inflation, although Northern inflation was nowhere as extreme as its Southern counterpart 
* During the war, Lincoln initiated the printing of a** national currency**.
    * Lincoln’s treasury secretary, Salmon P Chase, issued **greenbacks**, government issued paper money that was a precursor to Modern currency 

**Northern Strategies:**



* **Anaconda Plan** - The North would use their Naval advantage to blockade Southern ports and control the Mississippi R. It would effectively split the Confederacy in half.
* Destruction of Southern infrastructure.

**Southern Strategies:**



* Heavily relied on foreign help, especially from Britain and France. Britain and France were willing to fight because they heavily relied on exported cotton to keep their textile industries running.
* However, Britain and France abandoned “King Cotton” for the cotton trade in India and Egypt.

**The Republican Congress:**

Context:



* The secession of Southern States enabled the Republicans to dominate Congress. They promptly passed a series of landmark acts with far-reaching social and economic consequences 
* **Homestead Act (1862)** - Enabled settlers to acquire a free tract of 160 Acres of surveyed public land. Settlers acquired title to the land after 5 years of continuous residence
    *  Act opened the Great Plains to settlers 
* **The Morrill Land-Grant College act (1862)** -  conveyed 30,000 Acres of federal land per member of Congress from each state. The sales of land provided funds to create colleges of "Agricultural and Mechanical Arts" 
    * Land-grant colleges played an important role in promoting agriculture, engineering, and veterinary medicine 
* **The Pacific Railroad Act (1862)**  - Prior to the Civil War, southern congressmen supported a Transcontinental Railroad that would link New Orleans with California. Following the Civil War, Congress approved a transcontinental railroad that would run along a northern Central route linking Omaha, Nebraska with Sacramento, California 
* **The National Banking Act of 1863** -  Established a national banking system to provide a uniform currency. 
    * Banking policies have been a source of contention since the formation of the First National Bank in 1791. The rising cost of financing the Civil War highlighted the urgent need for a national currency and an orderly banking system 
    * No additional important changes were made in the national banking system has Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913

**Emancipation Proclamation (1863)** - A document that freed the enslaved. However, it freed zero slaves because the enslaved were on Confederate soil, the territory the Union did not have power over. The slaves in the border states were not freed either. This document is more of a military strategy than a document of freedom.



* Effects:
    * Effectively changed the landscape of the War. It was now about slavery and preserving the Union.
    * Enslaved workers in Confederacy escaped Plantations and ran to safety of Union lines
        * Some got involved in the military and fought for the Union cause. 
    * It closed the door on British involvement. 

**Battle of Vicksburg (1863) **- The Union gained control of the Mississippi R. under the leadership of General Grant. The Anaconda Plan was accomplished.

**Gettysburg Address (1863)** - Lincoln's purpose for giving the speech refram the purpose of the War: to unify the nation and portray the struggle against slavery as the fulfillment of America's founding democratic ideals.

**Sherman’s March to the Sea (1864)** - Led by William Tecumseh Sherman, he led Union troops on a March where they destroyed infrastructure and held to a scorched Earth policy.

**Assasination of Lincoln (1865)** - John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln at Ford Theatre. Andrew Johnson becomes the 17th President of the US.



* **Andrew Johnson** - 17th President of the US. He did attempt to carry out Lincoln’s plan for Reconstruction. Was a poor leader and had little sympathy for equality. He stood by as Southern States made similar laws to before the Civil War.

**Appomattox Courthouse (1865)** - Lee formally surrendered to Grant, marking the end of the Civil War.


### Consequences of the Civil War: 

**For the Federal Government **



* The Civil War ended a long-held southern principle of state sovereignty. States could no longer threaten to nullify a federal law or claim the right to secede
* The Civil War broadened the definition of federal power. The adoption of the** 13th Amendment** affirmed the supreme power of the federal government to abolish slavery, ensured the liberty of all Americans, and act on matters affecting "the general welfare" 

**For the South **



* Before the war, the southern planter elite played a disproportionate role in national affairs. The Civil War ended this long era of power. No native of a Southern State occupied the White House 50 years after 1861 
* Suffered devastating human losses. 
    * more than 258,000 Confederate soldiers died in the war, which constituted over 20% of the south adult white male population 
* Suffered devastating economic losses
    * In 1860, the cells contributed 30% of the nation's wealth. The Civil War destroyed Southern Homes, crops, livestock, and railroad mines. In 1870, the South contributed just 12% of the nation's wealth 
* Caused a severe reduction in the South political influence and economic prosperity. 
    * However it left the region’s commitment to white supremacy unbroken. This would create a problem that would not be successfully confronted until the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s 

**For the North **



* The Civil War solidified the alliance of Northern business interests and Western Farmers with the Republican Party
*  The war accelerated the creation of powerful corporate enterprises. This enhance the economic and political influence of a rising class of Northern "captains of industry”

**For the Women **



* Women in both the union and Confederacy accepted new responsibilities as more and more men left their homes and jobs to fight in the Army. 
    * In the South, planters’ wives and daughters learned how to manage their plantations. Women on smaller Farms plowed the fields and harvested their crops.
    * In North, women took paying jobs in business and government 
* Comment push the boundaries of their traditional roles by serving of nurses
    * The north set up a training program for nurses under dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first American woman to graduate from medical school.
    *  Clara Barton, who later founded the American Red Cross, helped overcome resistance to women working in military hospitals. Over 3,000 women served the nurses in Northern frontline hospitals 
* The Civil War did not remove barriers to sexual equality that had existed since the nation’s founding. However it did broaden beliefs about what women could accomplish outside of the homes

**For the Freed Slaves **



* The Civil War emancipated about four million slaves. However, existing laws still the none of them legal equality and the right to vote
*  Frederick Douglass succinctly described the placement of freed slaves: 
    * "he had neither money, property, nor friends. He was free from the old plantation, but he had nothing but the dusty Rhodes under his feet. ... He was turned loose, naked, hungry, and destitute to to the Open Sky," 


## Reconstruction (1863-1877)

Many questioned how the South would return to the Union. 

**Lincoln’s Plan (1863):**



* **Lenient Persuasion** - Lincoln’s position where the South is treated like they never left the Union. Being harsh with the South would increase tensions that led the South to secede.
* **Ten Percent Plan** - Established a minimum test of political loyalty for Southern States to return to the Union. Southern States had to agree with:
1. Could re-establish their state governments if 10% of the 1860 electorate pledged loyalty to the Union. 
2. State legislature had to ratify **the 13th Amendment (1865)** which abolished slavery.

**Johnson’s Plan (1865):**



* With Lincoln's assassination, Vice President Andrew Johnson assumed the presidency
*  Johnson favored a swift return to political and radical normalcy. 
    * Like Lincoln, he offered amnesty to most Confederates who took an oath of loyalty to the Union. Whites in each southern state could then elect delegates to a State Convention 
    * A state could render the union when its convention repealed all the session laws, repudiated Confederate debts, and ratified the 13th Amendment
*  Johnson did not support radical equality. His idea of radical normalcy was grounded in a firm belief in white supremacy. The clearing, "white men alone must manage the South,” Johnson stood aside as former rebels regained political power across the South 

**Black Codes** - Laws which restricted the freedom of Southern black folks and forced them to work for low wages.



* Laws designed to regulate the Affairs of emancipated blacks.
*  The 13th Amendment recognizes freedom, but not other privileges.
*   All codes for bait blocks to serve on the jury.
*  Some forbade them from  renting or leasing land.
*  Voting was illegal

**Radical Republicans** - Believed the South never had the right to secede, and focused on passing legislation that upheld and extended rights for black people in the South. Simultaneously, they suppressed any attempt at Southern resurgence.



* Appreciated Johnson’s leniency

**Freedmen’s Bureau** **(1865)** - Agency, set by the Radical Republicans, to help newly freed black people. It was a welfare agency that provided food, clothing, medical Care, and education to black and white refugees. It also educated 200,000 blacks to write and read. Johnson vetoed the law. Congress overrode his veto in a ⅔ majority.

**13th Amendment (1865)** - Abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, execpt as a punishment for a crime.

**Civil Rights Act of 1866** - Protected citizenship of blacks and protected them equally under the law. Johnson vetoed the law. Congress overrode his veto in a ⅔ majority.

**Reconstruction Acts of 1867** - Assured that all laws being passed would be enforced in the South. Radical Republicans divided the SOuth into five districts and put them under military occupation. The South had to agree to the 14th amendment.

**Tenure of Office Act (1867)** - Radical Republicans passed this act to make it illegal for a president to fire a member of his cabinet without congressional approval. Johnson ignored this act.

**14th Amendment (1868)** - All persons who were born or naturalized in the United States were citizens of the United States, and that every citizen enjoyed equal protection of the laws on the state level.



* Pushed for by the Radical Republicans.
* It gave:
1. Citizenship and civil rights
2.  The right to vote
3.  Disqualified Confederates from federal and state office
4.  Guaranteed federal debt 

**Impeachment of Andrew Johnson (1868)** - Johnson was impeached, but remained in office. He was tried for the violation of the Tenure of Office Act (1867).

**The 15th Amendment (1870) - **Marks the last 3 reconstruction amendments. It forbade either the federal government or the States from denying citizens the right to vote on the basis of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude”



* The 15th Amendment left leading women's rights activists feeling outraged and abandoned. They angrily demanded to know why Congress granted the suffrage to ex-slaves and not to women.

**Election of 1876** - Samuel Tilden runs against Rutherford B. Hayes. Tilden won the popular vote, but neither gained enough electoral votes to officially claim victory.



* **Compromise of 1877** - Democrats agreed to concede election to Hayes. Republicans agreed to remove all federal troops from the south. This marks the end of Reconstruction.
* Ruthorford B. Hayes becomes the 8th President of the US.


### The End of Reconstruction:



* **Scalawags** - The term "Scalawags" was a derogatory name used by Southerners as a name for Southern whites who supported Reconstruction. Scalawags took advantage of Reconstruction Laws of 1867. Black freedmen and Northerners teamed up with Scalawags to take control of local and state governments.
* **Carpetbaggers** - A pejorative term used by Southerners against Northerners who moved to the South during the Reconstruction era, between 1865 and 1877. The term suggested opportunism and exploitation by outsiders. In conjunction with Republicans, they are said to have politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for varying periods for their own financial and power gains
* **Ku Klux Klan - **Began in Tennessee in 1866 and quickly spread across the South. The Klan sought to maintain white supremacy by aiding the revival of the democratic party and by overthrowing The Radical Republicans
    * The Klan’s reign of Terror worked. Political intimidation and violence help the weakened Republican government. 
* Radical Republicans had long been the driving force behind the program to reconstruct Southern Society.
    * President Grant showed little enthusiasm for reconstruction. His administration soon became distracted by scandals 
    * A business panic in 1873 followed by crippling economic depression further undermined public support for reconstruction


## Time Period 6 (1877-1898):



* Gilded age presidents (Forgotten Presidents)
    * 1876 to 1880: Rutherford B Hayes republican
    * 1880 to 1884 James Garfield Republican killed
        * Vice president Chester A Arthur takes over
    * 1884 to 1888: Grover Cleveland Democrat
    * 1888 to 1892: Benjamin Harris republican
    * 1892 to 1896: Grover Cleveland democrat
    * 1896 to 1900 William McKinley republican
    * Gilded age coined by Mark Twain to criticize the Gilded Age


## The New South:



* Henry Grady’s Vision - managing editor of Atlanta Constitution; leading advocate of a "New South;" 
*  New South - The original use of the term "New South" was an attempt to describe the rise of a South after the Civil War which would no longer be dependent on now-outlawed slave labor or predominantly upon the raising of cotton, but rather a South which was also industrialized and part of a modern national economy
* James Buchanan Duke - Formed the American Tobacco Company, controlled 90% of the cigarette market
    * broken up in 1911 for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act


### Southern Agriculture:


## Sharecropping - system in which landowners leased a few acres of land to farmworkers in return for a portion of their crops



* Sharecropping did not lead to economic independence. Facing interest rates as high as 50%, sharecroppers became entrapped in a seemingly endless cycle of death and poverty.
* Sharecropping offered little hope for black and white tenants. During the 1890s the problem facing perpetual debt produced a harvest of discontent that led to the formation of farmers’ alliance and the beginning of the black migration out of the South 


## Tenancy - An ownership interest in land in which a lessee or a tenant holds real property by some form of title from a lesser or landlord. Many farmers became bankrupt under Tenancy.


## Crop lien system - System that allowed farmers to get more credit. They used harvested crops to pay back their loans


### The Restoration of White Supremacy:


## The redeemers: The end of reconstruction left political control in the south in the hands of a group of white Democratic Party leaders known collectively as redeemers because they “redeemed” or saved the region from Republican rule 



* Promoted economic growth based upon industrialization and railroad expansion. They also supported policies intended to restore a social system based upon white supremacy 
* Redeemer governments used literacy test and poll taxes to evade the 15th Amendment. 
    * Tactics worked and during the 1890s, the number of black voters plummeted. By early 1900s, African Americans had effectively lost their political rights in the south
* Mississippi Plan (1890) - in order to vote in Mississippi, citizens had to display the receipt which proved they had paid the poll tax and pass a literacy test by reading and interpreting a selection from the Constitution. Prevented blacks, who were generally poor and uneducated, from voting.


## Jim Crow Laws - Laws written to separate blacks and whites in public areas/meant African Americans had unequal opportunities in housing, work, education, and government.


## The Civil Rights Act of 1875 - guaranteed blacks “full and equal enjoyment” of public facilities. As more and more white Southerners rejected the idea of racial equality, Southern towns and companies begin to enact Jim Crow laws mandating racial segregation in public facilities 


## Civil rights case (1883) - The Supreme Court ruled that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only apply to state action and could not be used to regulate the behavior of private individuals or private organizations


## Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) - Allowed Jim Crow segregation laws to spread across the South. Within a few years, state and local statutes required segregated schools, restaurants, and hotels.


## The New West:


### Western Migration - Between 1870 and 1900, there was an unprecedented migration of miners, ranchers, and farmers into the West. By 1890, the US Census Bureau declared the frontier was officially settled.



* Mining towns attracted a diverse and combustible mix of white, American Indian, Mexican, and Chinese miners
    * Miners had hoped to get rich and then get out


## Causes:



* Homestead Act (1862) - People who settled were called  because 
    * Sodbusters - They were the first to cut through the soil with their plows. Some got land from the act or from buying.
* Completion of transcontinental railroads.


## Effects:



* Cattle trades boomed, which contributed to the cowboy image.


## Challenges: Due to weather conditions (blizzards, fires, and swarms of locusts) had to adapt



* Log cabins to sod houses
* New tools including mechanical reapers, wind-driven water pumps, and barbed-wire fences allowed farmers to overcome natural obstacles and build successful homestead


## Mechanization of Farming - Farming became more machine oriented and less human oriented.



* The Mechanical Reaper, and the Combine Harvester changed agriculture from man power to animal power
* Production of corn and wheat roughly doubled in this time period.
* Smaller farms failed as they couldn’t compete with corporate farmers.
* This period marks a drastic change from small farmers to large-scale mechanized farmers.


## The West was a not a desert nor uninhabited:



* Diverse land with Indians, Hispanics, Asians, and a growing number of American settlers


## Hispanic West: The land from Texas to California began from the Spanish Empire then the Mexican Republic. After the Mexican-American war, thousands of Hispanic people living in the region became residents of American territory



    * Lost their political authority and economic prosperity as more American settlers moved into the region, and by late nineteenth century became a part of a large working class


## Chinese: Gold rush and railroads created a mass migration of Chinese workers to California. By 1870s, Chinese immigrants comprised the largest non-European group in California



* At first they were praised for work ethic, but as their communities grew, many californians views then as economic rivals who worked for low wages
* Calls for immigration restriction grew louder and Congress responded by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
    * Suspended immigration of all Chinese laborers for ten years (renewed in 1892 and made it permanent in 1902)
    * Marked the first law enacted to exclude a specific ethnic or racial group from immigrating to the U.S.


### Natives - Violence occurs as homesteaders, miners and ranchers move west into native land.



* Sand Creek massacre (1864) - Colorado militia attacked and killed over 100 native people
* Battle of Little BigHorn (1876) - The Sioux tribe (inspired by sitting bull) killed Custer and his men in the 7th Calvary (Custer’s last stand)
* Chief Joseph attempted to lead members of the Nez Perce tribe into Canada
    * Surrendered in 1877
* Sioux War (1886) - The Sioux tribes resisted reservations, but it only led the federal government imposing more treaties.
* Ghost Dance Movement (1869) - The last effort of Native Americans to resist US domination and drive whites from their ancestral lands came through a religious movement known as the Ghost Dance. In the government's campaign to suppress the movement, the famous Sioux medicine man sitting Bull was killed during his rest. 
* Battle of Wounded Knee (1890) - US Army goes into the Dakotas to and killed over 200
    * The battle was really a massacre
    * Marks the end of the major Native American frontier wars


## Western Tribes: settled in the Great Plains, where horses thrived and Plains Indians became superb hunters, hunting buffalo for meat, clothes, and string for their bow



* Fort Laramie Treaty (1851) - Guaranteed safe passage for settlers on the Oregon trail and construction for roads/forts. In exchange the Indians received defined lands that would be theirs forever (a.k.a four decades)
* Life for the plains Indians had dramatically changed
    * Heavy reliant on hunting bison caused severe decline in the population of bison
        * Demand for buffalo hides
    * European introduction of the horse, fire arms, alcohol, and disease
    * Undermine native American resistance


## Life in a Trans-Mississippi West - The biggest impact of Western expansion will take place upon the lives of Native Americans in the trans-Mississippi West


## Attempts at Assimilation:



* Helen Hunt Jackson “A century of Dishonor” 1881 documented mistreatment by the federal government of native people
    * Supported policies designed to brine Naative Americans into mainstream of America life, playing a key role in mobilizing public support for the Dawes Act
* Boarding school such as Carlisle Indian school were intended to assimilate native people
* Dawes Severalty Act (1887) - tried to “civilize” Native Americans by turning them into independent self-supporting farmer
    * Dissolved the tribes as legal entities and divided their tribal lands into individual homesteads of 160 acres
    * End tribal ownership of land
    * Reservations split into 160 acres private farms
    * Natives had the potential to receive citizenship if they lived in the land for 25 years and “adopted the habits of civilized life”
    * Remaining reservations land sold to white settlers (often times the best land)
    * Act ignored the importance of traditional Indian culture 


## Closing of the frontier



* Frederick Jackson Turner writes “The significance of the frontier in America history” 1893
    * Argues frontier ended in 1890
    * Emphasizes the importance of the frontier on American identity
    * Safety valve theory: could head west when times times were tough
    * Ignores contributions of people already there, woman, fat people by 1890s moving to urban areas
* Connection: overseas expansion in 1890s


## Notable Reformers:


## Ida B Wells - Women activist who lead the lynching act


## Booker T. Washington -  African American progressive who supported segregation and demanded that African American better themselves individually to achieve equality.



* Believe that white racism was a consequence of slavery
* Atlanta Compromise Speech (1895) - Major speech on race-relations given by Booker T. Washington addressing black labor opportunities, and the peril of whites ignoring black injustice
* Supported vocational education. Helped found Tuskegee Institute in Alabama to prove industrial education for African Americans 
* Washington recognized that African-Americans faced a wall of discrimination that could only be overcome by gradual patients make gradual and patient progress. he believed that political rights would follow economic success 


## W.E.B. Du Bois - believed that African Americans should strive for full rights immediately;founded the NAACP



* Believed white racism was the cause of slavery and the primary reason why African Americans were forced into subordinate position in American society 
* Supported legal action to oppose Jim Crow segregation.
    *  Du bois helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The NAACP adopted a strategy of using lawsuits in federal court to fight Jim Crow segregation 
* Opposed Booker T Washington’s policy of gradualism and accommodation.
* Believe that economic success would only be possible if African Americans first one political rights.
    *  Du Bois therefore advocated a strategy of “ceaseless agitation" and litigation to achieve equal rights.


## **The Second Industrial Revolution **- began the following years after Civil War

Causes:

## The Gilded Age:

The era marks the beginning of the 2nd industrial revolution, with a lot of new opportunities and technologies. This draws immigrants to the US. However, there are unresolved problems like labor disputes, race, overcrowded cities, and pollution, but nobody seems to care…

**Pacific Railroad Acts (1862)** - The federal government granted land to railroad companies who would build a transcontinental railroad.



* Completed in 1869

**Homestead Act (1862)** - Law granted western settlers 160 acres of free land if they could farm and settle it.



* Mechanization of farms pushed out smaller farmers (ppl of the homestead act) out of the industry.
* Many farmers ended up going bust.

**Election of 1868** - Ulysses S. Grant became the 17th President of the US, with Schuyler Colfax, former Speaker of the House, as his vice president.



* Horatio Semyour, who didn't win the nomination, got the democatic nomination.

    * **Interstate Commerce Act (1886)** - required railroad rates to be reasonable and established the **Interstate Commerce Commission** to enforce railroad rates.

**Boss Tweed in Power (1868-1873)** - Tweed ran NYC’s powerful Democratic political machine organization (Tammany Hall) that helped immigrants in neighborhoods, most notably the Irish, and rose in politics as his society expanded. He was later convicted in 1877 for stealing an estimated 1-2$million in taxes through political corruption.



* **The Tweed Reign (1668-1669)** - A group of corrupt politicians in defrauding the city. Example: Responsible for the construction of the NY court house; actual construction cost $3million. Project cost taxpayers $13million.

**Gold Discovered at Pikes Peak** **(1869)** - Example of the gold rush. Influx of people going to regions in Kansas and Nebraska.



* Boomtowns had extremely diverse communities.

**Transcontinental Railroad (1869)** - Final spike driven in Utah of the transcontinental railroad.



* Government land grants facilitated and will facilitate the growing of railroads.
* The transcontinental railroad completed 1869 beginning the boom across the West

**Impacts of Transcontinental Railroad:**



* Cut travel time between the two coasts to just one week
* Became a visible symbol of national union
    * People could freely move across the entire country without passing though customs or passport control
* Created a bast integrated national market for raw materials and manufactured goods
* Created the four standardized time zones (present)
    * National rail lines required a uniform schedule so that passengers and freight could arrive and depart on time
* Affected the Plains Indians as the railroads exterminated herds of buffalo
* Created America’s first nationwide transportation system
    * Success doomed the pony express, wagon trains, stagecoach lines

**National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) (1869) **- A suffrage group headed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony that stressed the need for women to lead organizations on their own behalf. The NWSA focused exclusively on women's rights — sometimes denigrating men of color, in the process — and took up the battle for a federal women's suffrage amendment. Did NA like the 15th Amendment.

**American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) (1869)** - A women's suffrage organization led by Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell, and others who remained loyal to the Republican Party, despite its failure to include women's voting rights in the Reconstruction Amendments. Stressing the urgency of voting rights for African American men, AWSA leaders held out hope that once Reconstruction had been settled, it would be women's turn. Said EEYY to the 15th Amendment.

**The Indian Appropriation Act (1871)** - Ended federal recognition of the Sovereignty of Indian Nations. Nullified all treaties prior.

**Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)** - The Supreme Court carried the logic of legal segregation a significant step further.It upheld segregation by approving “separate but equal" railroad facilities for African Americans 

* Allowed Jim Crow segregation laws to spread across the South. Within a few years, state and local statutes required segregated schools, restaurants, and hotels 


## Time Period 7 (1890-1945):


## Imperialism:

Imperialists wanted to expand and argued with Manifest Destiny.

Anti-Imperialists argued that colonizing would restrict the freedom of other countries and it would get US involved in international affairs

Causes:



* Quest for new markets and raw materials 
* **_the influence of Sea power upon history_ by Alfred T Mahan:**Argued that the United States must build a powerful ocean-going navy, construct the canal across the Isthmus to link the East Coast with the Pacific, and acquire strategically-located colonies to provide coaling stations and repair facilities for Military and Commercial fleets

    *  Became the Cornerstone of American strategic thinking 
* The ideology of expansion: **social Darwinism and The White Man's Burden** 

**The Spanish-American War **- War fought between the US and Spain in Cuba and the Philippines. It lasted less than 3 months and resulted in Cuba's independence as well as the US annexing Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.

Causes:

* **Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901)** - Also known as The Boxer Uprising, this was the popular peasant uprising in China (supported nationally), that blamed foreign people and institutions for the loss of the traditional Chinese way of life. "Boxers" were traditionally skilled fighters that attacked Westerners, beginning with Christian missionaries.

## The Cold War (1947-1991)

**Causes**:



* The US emerged from WWII as the world’s most powerful and prosperous country. In contrast, the Soviuet union suffered heavy losses during the ar. 
* The allies agreed that central and eastern european countries would hold free elections. But Stalin decided he’d rather keep soviet troops stationed in those countries after the war to create a “buffer zone” between Russia and Germany. Those states became “Communist Satellite States.”
* There were also many disputes over Berlin. The city was split between the allies, but was in the middle of Svoeit land. These disputes caused mistrust between the US and the Soviets.
* The British and the US wanted to help Germany revitalize its economy. However, the Soviets wanted to weaken and collect reparations from them. Differing ideas (communism v. democracy) would split Europe in half separated by an “iron curtain.”
    * **The Iron Curtain** - A term coined by Winston Churchill, describing the no longer independent nations of Eastern Europe, becoming satellite states controlled by the Soviets.
* The American economy was growing more dependent on Exports, so helping the defeated european countries’ economies would help American’s economy too (Marshall Plan).

**Reconstruction of Japan (1945-1952)** - After WWII, the US occupied Japan, and its colonial possessions were divided up. The US took control of the Pacific Islands and the southern half of Korea, while the USSR took control of the northern Half of Korea.



* Under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, Japan wrote a democratic constitution, demilitarized, and started a remarkable economic revival.

**Chinese Communist Revolution (1945-1952)** - The US tried to stop communism in China, however it was unsuccessful.



* The US supported Chaing Kai-sheck’s Nationalist government against Mao Zedon’s Communist insurgents. Despide massive American military aid, the Communists overthrew the Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan. For years, the US refused to recognize the legitimacy of Mao’s regime.

**Containment** - A U.S. foreign policy adopted by President Harry Truman (Truman Doctrine) in the late 1940s, in which the United States tried to stop the spread of communism by creating alliances and helping weak countries to resist Soviet advances.



* The idea came from the **Long Telegram (1946)**, which Geroge Kennan sent to Washington from Germany.
* In the Eisenhower Administration, it is known as **liberation**, to make containment more intimidating.

**Truman Doctrine (1947)** -Advocated containment of communism by lending support to any country that was  threatened by communism. The main idea was containment.

* Inspired Soviet Union to create the German Democratic Republic (Eastern Germany) and explode an atomic bomb in 1949, and set up a rival eastern bloc military alliance, the Warsaw Pact in 1955; sparked the massive arms race known as the Cold War.

**Warsaw Pact (1955)** - Basically NATO for communists.

**The Arms Race **- Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact put military might behind the countries’ differing ideas. Because of this, it began a Cold war competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to build up their respective armed forces and weapons. This was the main idea behind the cold war-- each side builds arms upon arms.
